# PSOC&trade; 6 MCU: XENSIV&trade; 60 GHz radar presence detection

This code example demonstrates Infineon's radar presence detection sensor solution for human presence sensing within a configurable distance using the XENSIV&trade; [BGT60TR13C](https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/product/sensor/radar-sensors/radar-sensors-for-iot/60ghz-radar/bgt60tr13c) and [BGT60UTR11AIP](https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/product/sensor/radar-sensors/radar-sensors-for-iot/60ghz-radar/bgt60utr11aip) 60 GHz radar sensors. This solution provides extremely high accuracy in detecting both micro and macro motions, enabling efficient user interaction with devices.

The code example utilizes a special optimization mechanism to demonstrate the switching between different radar device configurations on the fly. Depending on the application use case, you can switch between two or more radar configurations. For example, you can switch from a radar device configured for presence detection to gesture control based on certain conditions within the user application (e.g., the range bin information of the detected target).

The code example demonstrates how the presence detection application can benefit from using power-saving features enabled through dynamic reconfiguration. The present example takes an advantage of the opportunity to save power by reconfiguring the radar sensor to slow down the frame rate. This is particularly beneficial, especially when running in the `MICRO_IF_MACRO` mode. This mechanism is detailed in the [Optimization mechanism](#optimization-mechanism) section.

   **Figure 8. Terminal output choosing different configurations**

   ![](images/terminal_multiple_configs.png)

   <br>

   **Table 1. Terminal outputs**

   Parameters  | Event type  | Description
   ----------- | ----------- | ----- 
   Radar state | Macro presence  | Presence event detected
   Range bin  | 2 | Maximum range bin
   Time stamp | '4298' | Relative time in ms
   Current presence state | 0 | 0: Macro <br> 1: Micro <br> 2: Absence
   Current radar setting | 10 Hz | 10 Hz: Low frame rate <br> 200 Hz: High frame rate
   New radar setting | macro/micro | Depends on the detection
   
   <br>

   > **Note:** *Time Stamp* is relative to the boot time, which means that when the application boots up first, the time counting starts from 0 ms.

   Conversion of range bin to range in meters can be done by using the following relation:

   ```
   R (range in meters) = (xensiv_radar_presence_get_bin_length() * config.max_range_bin)
   ```

   For example: If `xensiv_radar_presence_get_bin_length()` = 0.325, **R = 0.325 * 2 = 0.66 m**

   <br>

   Note the following:

   - **Micro motions:** Detecting small movements such as finger gestures or small head movements in a typical smart home environment. These include working on a laptop or keyboard, or normal breathing, and blinking of the eyes in sitting or standing positions (in line of sight)

   - **Macro motions:** Detecting major movements into or through the field of view (motion detection)

   > **Note 1:** Macro and micro threshold parameters can be adjusted to achieve different levels of sensitivity. The following table summarizes three different levels. For example, high sensitivity means that the solution is more sensitive to smaller movements. You can set any threshold values based on your use case requirement

   > **Note 2:** If you want to see the data to be printed continuously in the serial terminal, enable the verbose


   **Table 7. Sensitivity levels with corresponding threshold setting**

   Sensitivity|Macro threshold value |Micro threshold value

## Debugging

You can debug the example to step through the code.


<details><summary><b>In Eclipse IDE</b></summary>

Use the **\<Application Name> Debug (KitProg3_MiniProg4)** configuration in the **Quick Panel**. For details, see the "Program and debug" section in the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; user guide](https://www.infineon.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide).

> **Note:** **(Only while debugging)** On the CM4 CPU, some code in `main()` may execute before the debugger halts at the beginning of `main()`. This means that some code executes twice – once before the debugger stops execution, and again after the debugger resets the program counter to the beginning of `main()`. See [PSOC&trade; 6 MCU: Code in main() executes before the debugger halts at the first line of main()](https://community.infineon.com/docs/DOC-21143) to learn about this and for the workaround.

The radar configuration parameters are generated from a PC tool and saved in *radar_settings.h* file. For more details, see the [XENSIV&trade; BGT60TRxx Radar API Reference Guide](https://infineon.github.io/sensor-xensiv-bgt60trxx/html/index.html).

After initialization, the application runs in an event-driven way. The radar interrupt is used to notify the MCU, which retrieves the raw data into a software buffer and then triggers the main task to normalize and feed the data to the presence library.

### Optimization mechanism

This code example uses a special optimization mechanism to demonstrate the switching between different radar device configurations:

- Low frame rate is sufficient for macro movement detection

- High frame rate is required for micro movement detection

Therefore, in the default presence detection mode of `MICRO_IF_MACRO`, the radar device can be configured with a low frame rate by default and only reconfigured with a high frame rate configuration when it is expected to perform micro detection. By implementing such a mechanism, the application benefits from **some power-savings**.

In the processing task, the optimization object is initialized with the reconfiguration function pointer. The application then runs the presence algorithm normally. The evaluation for the reconfiguration of the radar device is performed in two cases:

- The application receives a request to change the presence detection mode (e.g., from `MACRO_ONLY` to `MICRO_IF_MACRO`)

- A change in the presence detection state occurs (e.g., from absence to macro detected)

The radar device reconfiguration involves rewriting the radar registers with a new set of values, reconfiguring the radar FIFO limit, and restarting the radar frame

**Figure 12. Radar activity**

### Configuration logic

The following configuration logic (see **Figure 12**) is deployed in the evaluation process when the application is operating in `MICRO_IF_MACRO` mode.

- If the radar is currently configured with a low frame rate and has detected a macro presence, it can detect a micro presence. Therefore, the radar needs to be reconfigured with a high frame rate

- If the radar is currently configured with a high frame rate and has detected a macro presence instead of a micro presence, the radar can be reconfigured with the low frame rate to save power

- If the radar is currently configured with a high frame rate and there is no presence detected (absence), the radar can be reconfigured with a low frame rate to detect a macro presence

**Table 8. Switching to MICRO_IF_MACRO mode**

Radar current state |Last detected state |Radar new mode
----------- | ----------- | -----
Low frame rate | MACRO | High frame rate
High frame rate | MACRO| High frame rate
High frame rate  | ABSENCE | Low Frame rate

### Adding different configurations

Each radar configuration is a structure containing a pointer to a register list, the number of registers, and the FIFO limit. To use a radar configuration suitable for your application, perform these steps:

- In *optimization_list.h* file, edit or add to the existing configurations (i.e., `optimizations_list[]` and `optimization_type_e`) in the code example.

- Provide the new configuration register list per the example given in *radar_high_framerate_config.h* and *radar_low_framerate_config.h* files. You can use the [XENSIV&trade; BGT60TRxx Radar Sensor](https://github.com/Infineon/sensor-xensiv-bgt60trxx) to generate the register list.


```c
typedef struct {
    uint32_t *reg_list;
    uint8_t reg_list_size;
    uint32_t fifo_limit;
} optimization_s;
```

```c
optimization_s optimizations_list[] = {
    {
        register_list_macro_only,
        XENSIV_BGT60TRXX_CONF_NUM_REGS_MACRO,
        NUM_SAMPLES_PER_FRAME * 2
    },
    {
        register_list_micro_only,
        XENSIV_BGT60TRXX_CONF_NUM_REGS_MICRO,
        NUM_SAMPLES_PER_FRAME * 2
    },
    {
        register_list_user_config,
        XENSIV_BGT60TRXX_CONF_NUM_REGS_USER_CONFIG,
        NUM_SAMPLES_PER_FRAME * 2
    }
};
```

```c
typedef enum {
    CONFIG_LOW_FRAME_RATE_OPT,
    CONFIG_HIGH_FRAME_RATE_OPT,
    CONFIG_USER_CONFIG_OPT,
    CONFIG_UNINITIALIZED = 64
} optimization_type_e;
```


## Optimizer API

**Table 9. API functions**

API function | Description
-------------|------------
`radar_config_optimizer_init` | Initializes optimization component. Requires a pointer to the radar reconfiguration function
`radar_config_optimizer_set_operational_mode` | Saves the new mode to which you want to switch. This function is called during mode selection in the CLI
`radar_config_optimize` | Switches to the new mode. The new list of registers is chosen and saved into the radar, depending on the selected mode and last presence event
`radar_config_get_current_optimization` | Returns the current chosen optimization mode: low or high frame rate
